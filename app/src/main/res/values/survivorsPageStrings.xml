    <string name="survivorsMainText">Survivors are the various playable characters available in Risk of Rain 2, each with their own
        unique abilities. Players start with only the Commando and Huntress available, and can unlock the rest by accomplishing various
        Challenges. Survivors are known as such due to the result of a space-bound catastrophe, although in RoR2 the case is revealed
        by the game\'s lore to be on a rescue mission aboard the UES Safe Travels, sent to look for the remains of RoR1\'s UES Contact
        Light. In this case, it\'s likely the name \"Survivor\" is used simply because it was also used in RoR1, not because it has
        significance to the plot of RoR2.\n\nThere are currently fourteen playable survivors (the Railgunner and Void Fiend being
        available in the DLC Survivors of the Void).</string>
