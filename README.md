An attempt to build a Risk of Rain 2 wiki app from scratch

In April of 2022, I sat down with an idea to build an app for my friends and I to use. We actively played Risk of Rain 2 at the time.

Risk of Rain 2 is a third person rougulite survival game which tasks the player with killing enemies, buying items, defeating a stage boss, and moving onto the next area. My friends and I often resorted to the Fan Wiki page for Risk of Rain 2 to remember item stats, stacking stats, item interaction with abilities, and Survivor unique traits. 

Due to this constant seeking of game information, I chose to build an Android App for my friends and I to have access to all of the information of the Fan Wiki. This process was a lot of busy work, as most of the information had to manually entered into tables. Due to the excessive time requirement and my discovery that many apps like this already existed, I unfortunately abandoned the project. However, I am very proud of my work.

This project was created in conjuction with https://github.com/cory-eheart-1/RoR2-scraper. The linked project is a python script which scraped the information needed for every survivor. I did not make it through every item.
