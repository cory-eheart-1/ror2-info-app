An attempt to build a Risk of Rain 2 wiki app from scratch

In April of 2022, I sat down with an idea to build an app for my friends and me to use. We actively played Risk of Rain 2 at the time.

Risk of Rain 2 is a third-person rougelite survival game that tasks the player with killing enemies, buying items, defeating a stage boss, and moving on to the next area. My friends and I often resorted to the Fan Wiki page for Risk of Rain 2 to remember item stats, stacking stats, item interaction with abilities, and Survivor unique traits. 

Due to this constant seeking of game information, I chose to build an Android App for my friends and me to have access to all of the information on the Fan Wiki. This process was a lot of busy work, as most of the information had to be manually entered into tables. Due to the excessive time requirement and my discovery that many apps like this already existed, I, unfortunately, abandoned the project. However, I am very proud of my work.

This project was created in conjunction with https://github.com/cory-eheart-1/RoR2-scraper. The linked project is a python script that scraped the information needed for every survivor. I did not make it through every item.
